# CircRM
## Brief introduction

CircRM, a nanopore sequencing–based computational method for profiling RNA modifications in circRNAs at single-base and single-molecule resolution. By integrating circRNA detection, read-level methylation prediction, and comparative analyses with linear RNAs, we systematically characterized three major modifications—m5C, m6A, and m1A—in circRNAs.
